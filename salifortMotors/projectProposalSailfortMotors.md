# Salifort Motors Project Proposal
---

### Overview:

Predict employee departure and deploy different models to analyze a dataset and generate business insights for  stakeholders. In particular, build and evaluate a logistic regression model or the following machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, organize and communicate key information and update your stakeholders through an executive summary.

Things to keep present:

1. Do I need ML for this project?
2. Define Objectives.
3. Split.
4. Explore
5. Prepare tools.
6. Action, preform.
7. Debug, Analyse, Tune.
8. Validate.
9. Test.


### Milestones:


**First -** One day.
- Establish structure for project workflow (PACE) Plan and, 
- Write a project proposal Plan.
- The report has a Global-level, make a project document.

**Second** One, Two Days
- Plan-Analyze and compile summary information about the data.
- Data files ready for EDA.

**Third** One, Two Days
- Plan-Analyze, EDA.
- Construct - Analyze, Visualizations.

**Fourth** One, Two Days
- Descriptive Statistics. Analysis testing result two important variables, share. - - Hypothesis testing, share. Visualizations, share.

**Fifth** One, Two Days
- Construct-Analyze, Build a regression model.
- Execute-Analyze, Evaluate the model.
- Review testing results, determine success.

**Sixth** One, Two Days
