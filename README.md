Hi, my name is Mario Hevia and this is a portfolio containing the projects for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Here you can find information related to three projects in three folders:

- Automatidata folder[folder](https://github.com/marioymario/Portfolio2023/tree/main/automatidata)
  - dataInsightDS folder: **Second** part of the project, focus on EDA.
  - MLDS: **Fifth** part of the project focus on Machine Learning.
  - pythonDS: **First** part of the project, focus on first observation of the data.
  - regressionDS: **Fourth** part of the project, focused on linear regression and data relationships.
  - StatsDS: **Third** part of the project focused on statistics and A/B test.
- TikTok folder [folder](https://github.com/marioymario/Portfolio2023/tree/main/TikTok)
  - dataInsightDS: **Second** part of the project, focus on EDA.
  - pythonDS: **First** part of the project, focus on first observation of the data.
  - regressionDS: **Fourth** part of the project, focused on linear regression and data relationships.
  - StatsDS: **Third** part of the project focused on statistics and A/B test.
- Waze folder [folder](https://github.com/marioymario/Portfolio2023/tree/main/Waze)
  - dataInsightDS: **Second** part of the project, focus on EDA.

- salifortMotors folder [folder](https://github.com/marioymario/Portfolio2023/tree/main/salifortMotors)
  - **Data** in csv format.
  - 3 pickles models.
  - A **strategy** documents.
  - A project proposal.
  - Notebook.
  - An executive summary.

In each project folders, you may find sub-folders (one per course), and in each sub-folder a course folder, inside the sub-folders most of the time, documents like: 

- Overview of the meeting notes.

- A **PACE** strategy document, with stages to assist answering questions of the project parts.

- A **project proposal** with the time line of the whole project.

- A **notebook** with the process for reproducibility

- An **Executive Summary** with relevant information to the task.

This MD's have information and the steps taken for each project, notebooks and results.
Please feel free to look at any or all, but remember some are consequential.

The layout is based per course.

here > [GDACP](https://github.com/marioymario/GDAPC), you can access to personal notes from the same course.

And here > [gatoEDA](https://pypi.org/project/gatoeda65/) a module that I created with the functions I used for EDA.

Thanks for the consideration.
